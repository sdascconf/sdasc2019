With increasing importance of statistical inference methods and their use at
large cloud and warehouse-scale computing industry, we propose a workshop called
Scalable Data Analytics in Scientific Computing (SDASC). It will
feature automated data analysis efforts on the convergence of computational
science, HPC, and large scale data analytics and inference.  The workshop will
focus on integration of the HPC techniques and statistical learning and
related tasks into modern computational software stack.

The half-day workshop will gather experts from the computational science, HPC,
and machine learning. The committee members are recognized in their respective
fields as experts of note and will assure fulfilment of the goals of the
workshop outlined below.

This workshop could also be considered as a complementary event to the Machine
Learning Learning Day slated to take place at ISC 2019.

The workshop aims to establish a forum of discourse and exchange of ideas about
current practices for HPC and data analytics integration. The outcomes will
include discussion about contemporary methods and implementation techniques
that unify modern statistical inference, latest software stacks for Machine
Learning deployed on supercomputing machines with hardware accelerators.

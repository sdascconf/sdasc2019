Call for Papers
===============

Scalable Data Analytics in Scientific Computing (SDASC) workshop invites
submissions of original research. The event will be co-located with
ISC High Performance 2019 conference. More details available at:

https://sdascconf.github.io/

With the increasing importance of methods originating in statistical
inference and their growing use at large cloud computing facilities,
both scientific and HPC communities are looking into new ways of
applying computational steering to their large scale simulations. The
workshop will feature automated data analysis efforts at the convergence
of computational science, HPC, and large scale data analytics and
inference. The focus will be on the integration of the HPC techniques
and statistical learning tasks into the modern software stack of
computational science.

The half-day SDASC workshop will gather experts from the computational
science, HPC, and machine learning communities. The committee members
are recognized in their respective fields as experts of note and will
assure fulfilment of the goals of the workshop.

This workshop could also be considered as a complementary event to the
Machine Learning Learning Day slated to take place at ISC 2019 that is
becoming a mainstay of the event.


==================
Topics of Interest
==================

A list of topics of interest for speakers and attendees include:

-  Scientific data set creation, ingest, curation, and analysis with
   statistical inference
-  Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications
   and their deployment on supercomputing and cluster platforms
-  Computational steering through Machine Learning models
-  Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
   collections and output data sets of computational simulations
-  Multi-precision inference methods and their use on modern hardware
   for simulation data
-  Novel use of discriminative and generative Machine Learning
   approaches for scientific data sets including Adversarial and
   Reinforcement Learning
-  Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
   computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
-  Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale  for
   methods related deep neural network training, stochastic gradient
   descent, loss-function engineering, etc.
-  Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
-  Hyperparameter search and optimization for large scale inference
-  Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
   TensorFlow, (Py)Torch, Caffe 1/2, Keras, MxNet combined with their
   integration with large scale simulations through containers
   (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift), virtualizaiton,
   colocation, etc.

We also welcome cross-cutting submissions that are span some of the
topics mentioned above.

=====================
Submission guidelines
=====================

The workshop will use single-blind peer review.  The submitted
manuscripts will be reviewed anonymously but the authors will be known
to the reviewers. Submissions will be scored on the following criteria:
originality, technical strength and correctness as well as significance,
quality of presentation, and relevance to the workshop topics of
interest.

With respect to originality: the submitted manuscripts should have _NOT_
appeared in at another venue such as conference, workshop, symposium, or
published in a journal.  Also, the manuscript should _NOT_ be under
consideration for another such a venue or journal.

The accepted papers will be published in Springer proceedings (see
below for deadlines, dates, and format).

Manuscripts will be 12 pages maximum excluding the references (we
encourage authors to include relevant references).
Papers need to be formatted according to Springer's single column LNCS
style (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0
for LaTeX and Word templates).  Note: 12 pages LNCS is roughly
equivalent to 6 pages in double column IEEE format.

The submissions are handled by Easy Chair:
